# DNAStrings
A simple analysis program that will compute basic statistics for a list of DNA strings. The program will then generate a list of 1000 "replica" DNA strings based on Gaussian Distribution and the computed statistics. 

Statistics for DNA strings:
- Sum
- Mean
- Variance
- Standard Deviation
- Nucleotide Probability
- Bigram Probability

Input: 
- When prompted, input the name of your text file as is (no quotations)

Output: 
- Statistics will be sent to "lisapham.out"
- File outputs are labeled with the input file name
